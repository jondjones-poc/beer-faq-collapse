                <h3 class="title">How do I brew Beer?</h3>
                <p class="text">You can make it totally from scratch using grain which involves crushing roasted malted barley, simmering it at specific temperatures, straining, sparging (rinsing), then boiling it, adding hops and then cooling it before adding the yeast (all this will take you about 6 hours) and then fermenting and bottling the finished beer</p>

                <h3 class="title">Is it difficult to make your own beer?</h3>
                <p class="text">No, making beer is easy.  If you have enough time, then make it from scratch otherwise using kits is a very easy and very tasty way of getting beer just like youâ€™d drink in a pub.</p>

                <h3 class="title">How long does it take to brew a kit?</h3>
                <p class="text">Fermentation usually takes about a week, with another couple of weeks waiting for it to clear.  It can take as little at 3 weeks from making to drinking, but the longer it is left to mature the better.</p>
